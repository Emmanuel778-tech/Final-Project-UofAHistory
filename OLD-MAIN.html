            <div class="History">
                <p>Old Main is the University of Arizona's first building, completed in 1891, serving as classrooms, dorms, and library for the nascent university, symbolizing its enduring legacy despite periods of disrepair, military use during WWII, and major 2014 renovations that preserved its historic charm while modernizing it for today's university core, housing the President's office and museum.</p>
